                    <h2>Long Story Short</h2>
                    <p>I just got done reading all the docs on HTML on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> so made this website to have a project as proof that i did.</p>
                    <h2>Short Story Long</h2>
                    <p>My github has been as dry as my love life and I want to be able to make my github public in my discord connections just like those chads in coding discord servers do, i also saw this website called <a href="https://www.jackmcdade.com">jackmcdade.com</a> and fell in love with it, if you're still reading this, i genuinly thank you, so i'm currently planning to make my own portfolio website so this one is basically the first step towards actually make that one, we gotta start somewhere don't we?</p>
