                    <h1>Why does this website exist.....good question</h1>
                    <h2>Long Story Short</h2>
                    <p>I just got done reading all the docs on HTML on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> so made this website to have a project as proof that i did.</p>
                    <h2>Short Story Long</h2>
                    <p>My github has been as dry as my love life and I want to be able to make my github public in my discord connections just like those chads in coding discord servers do, i also saw this website called <a href="https://www.jackmcdade.com">jackmcdade.com</a> and fell in love with it, if you're still reading this, i genuinly thank you, so i'm currently planning to make my own portfolio website so this one is basically the first step towards actually make that one, we gotta start somewhere don't we?</p>

                    <h1>Waste of time</h1>
                    <p>A few days after i made this website, i thought that this was a waste of time, which it might have been, still not sure about it, but now that i think about it, i kinda enjoyed making this and it makes me happy, so i guess it doesn't matter if it was a waste of time or not, because i enjoyed writing it.</p>
