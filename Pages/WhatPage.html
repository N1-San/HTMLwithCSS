                    <h1>What is this Website.....good question</h1>
                    <h2>Long Story Short</h2>
                    <p>This is a website made with using only HTML and has almost all non-depricated html tags that i could find, but you've already read that about 3 times now, so please go ahead and read the "Short Story Long" part.</p>
                    <h2>Short Story Long</h2>
                    <p>The long story, this is a website created to prove that you don't need fancy plugins and frameworks to make a website that is functional, there are limitations to how it will look but the functionality is always there........and If i'm being honest, this page does not have much purpose....this was just a made up thing that i don't really know what to call, but hey, on the bright side, we would not have bonded this much, i don't know about you but i had fun writing all this, have fun checking out the other parts of the website.</p>

                    <h1>What New</h1>
                    <p>There is not much that's new here, the one major change is the nav bar, it looks kinda neat and i like it. While i was adding css to this, i kept getting a lot of ideas about what i'm going to add when i'll be addind JavaScript to this website, apart from that, this was the most basic css stuff that i found, i did not add every css attribute because i'm not sure if that's worth it, if you think it is, let me know through twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AnikiCodes">@anikicodes</a> or dm on instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/anikidraws">@anikidraws</a>(ik it looks like i haven't used it in years, but i do)</p>
