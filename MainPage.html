                    <p>The above 3 images have no specific purpose than to take up space to make this website look more filled. This was not originally the plan when i was making the design for the website on my notebook, i changed it because the previous design required a lot of css and i want this to be an HTML only website, hence the name of the website.</p>
                    <p>p.s. i made those pictures myself using reference images ofcourse, but yes those are mine.</p>

                    <p>Yes i made the design for this webiste on my notebook before making it. Check my github for images of the notebook.</p>

                    <p>i was not expecting many people to read the whole thing, and if you, the person currently reading this, has read the whole thing as well, i really appreciate it, and yes i have copied the whole thing to make this website but i did write a few extra text boxs like this one, but to avoid it being a pain in the ass to find, i have highlighted them in this redish orangish color, if you think i should change anything, feel free to let me know on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AnikiCodes">@anikicodes</a>, yes i have a twitter now.</p>
                    <p>ohh right, Fade also corrected a few typos in the previous website and i accepted his pull request, if you are not fade and you find any typo, feel free to make a pull request, i would be happy to look into it.</p>
