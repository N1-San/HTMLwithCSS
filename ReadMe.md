# HTMLwithCSS
**This repo is for a website that i initially made using only HTML and nothing else.....kinda but here it is with css.....why? because why not?**

**Perks**
- Simple
- Elegant
- actually looks good this time
- with bright colors this time
- still no flashy animations

> well, there is still not much to write about it in a readme file, have fun with the website tho.
>P.S. if you just stumbled upon this repo, feel free to check out the prequel to this series called HTMLonly, you'll find it in my other repositories, thanks, i love you.
## This is kinda a work in progress right now, i will post a link to it on my twitter when i'm done with it, feel free to check it out right now anyways, thanks
